# Four Colors of Ohio Counties

## Fall 2021 AI Final Project

This program takes in the adjacency map of counties in Ohio and its surrounding states, finds a color state that satisfies the constraint of no two adjacent nodes being the same color, and then generates an automatically colored image of the counties.

## To-do

* Add different heuristics
* Separate utility functions into their own file
* Clean up the code to be more readable
